# Reinforcement Learning Project : Maze 

Here's our repository dedicated to Reinforcement Learning. A small project will be conducted and used as a course project at ENSTA Paris.

We aim here to implement different Reinforcement Learning algorithms in order to exit a maze first

You'll find here several folders :

/Include is for the headers

/src is for the algorithms and the environnements by themselves.
